      <h2>Frontend Engineer</h2>

      <p>
        I enjoy working closely with teammates to build robust applications
        which enrich user experience providing a faster, responsive and
        consistent navigation. Iâ€™ve been working as a Frontend Engineer for
        almost 4 years, developing applications using tools such as Angular,
        React, Web Components, RxJS, Jest and Storybook. The perfomance
        optimization is the most interesting area for me and I am currently
        learning about microfrontend and Qwik.
